# 🎓 Final Year Project: Teacher-Facing Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview

In the modern educational system, tracking and analyzing student performance is a time-consuming task for teachers. Our project, **Teacher-Facing Dashboard**, aims to simplify this process by providing an interactive dashboard that helps educators assess student performance efficiently.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Teachers spend significant time manually reviewing student data, leading to inefficiencies and delays in providing valuable feedback. The challenge is to automate the data collection, processing, and visualization to enhance decision-making and improve student outcomes.

## 🛠️ Solution & Implementation

Our solution is a **Teacher-Facing Dashboard** built using **Streamlit**, a Python-based framework that enables rapid prototyping of interactive web applications. The dashboard integrates machine learning techniques to classify and extract student performance data, providing actionable insights in real-time.

### 🔹 Key Features:
- 📊 **Data Visualization**: Interactive charts and tables for an intuitive representation of student progress.
- 🏆 **Performance Tracking**: Automated classification of students based on grades, attendance, and engagement.
- 📂 **Data Extraction & Processing**: Machine learning models analyze raw student data and categorize it efficiently.
- ⏳ **Time Optimization**: Reduces manual effort by 70%, allowing teachers to focus more on mentoring students.
